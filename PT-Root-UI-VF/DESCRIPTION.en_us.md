PT Root UI VF (variable font) is a modern uniwidth sans serif whose individual character widths are constant across all weights. This is especially convenient for headers, menu bars and interface elements. It has a broad language support, including the Latin Extended and Cyrillic (including Cyrillic Asian), different sets of figures and currency signs, fractions and indices, as well as a number of wayfinding signs and alternative forms. PT Root UI was designed by Vitaly Kuzmin and released by [Paratype](https://www.paratype.com) in 2018.
